# Unity-SharedSpatialAnchors

Unity-SharedSpatialAnchors was built to demonstrate how to use the Shared Spatial Anchors API, available in the Meta XR Core SDK for the Unity game engine.

The sample app showcases:
- Spatial Anchor Creation, Saving, Loading, and Sharing
- Scene Sharing
- Automatic Colocation
- Passthrough Avatars

This app uses Photon Unity Networking to share anchor data and support interaction with networked objects in a colocated space.

This codebase is available both as a reference and as a template for a project that utilizes shared spatial anchors. Unity-SharedSpatialAnchors is under the license found [here](LICENSE) unless otherwise specified.
